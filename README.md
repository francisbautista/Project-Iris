TwitterGeoStreamer: http://twitter.francisbautista.me:8080/
=========

Streams tweets over a certain geographic region (currently the Philippines) in real-time and plots them on a mapbox basemap.

TODO:
- Enable dynamic bounding-box selection with keyword-based filtering.
- Improve styling for navbar and filtering
- Scale streaming to use leaflet-realtime.
